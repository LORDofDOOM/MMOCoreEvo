Database is TDB: http://github.com/LORDofDOOM/MMODatabase
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to build/compile:

You can build the core with the mmoupdater.sh shellscript. Simply edit
mmoconfig.ini and change username/password for the user that should run
the core/database. I suggest to set up a user "trinity". This user 
should also exist as mysql user. Make mmoupdater.sh executable and
run it. Compile and database will be setup complete auto. Spawns etc.
will be backup and batch into your new core each time you run this
script ("TRINITY_WORLD_TEMP") - You don't need to batch database 
manually anymore. You can use this for any future update.

The Characater and Auth Database will NOT be update with this script.

TrinityCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the
code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve
and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit
